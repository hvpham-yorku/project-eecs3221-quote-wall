## Key Personas: ##

## Key Principles: ##
*Ease of use* - The website should be easy to understand and simple to use. The website is designed for people who are working, so they shouldn't be bogged down clicking through difficult-to-understand menus or settings. They should be able to quickly log on, load their profile, and get back to work.

*Customizability* - The user should be able to choose how and when their content is shown to them. They should be able to choose their interests so that their quotes are tailored to them, as well as the frequency of the quotes so they never feel like they go too long without something interesting happening. Text size and accessibility options should also be available.
