# Quote Wall: #

### EECS 3311 N W2025 | Group 4 ###

# Summary: #

## Objective: ##
Develop a website that allows the user to select one or more from a list of various interests (sports, film & tv, gaming, etc.). The website will then display a quote or inspirational message along with an accompanying image from one of their selected interests. The quotes appear on a fully customizable schedule, allowing the user to choose how often the quotes change, and how they appear on the screen, among other things.

## Key Personas: ##
As this is a website, the target audience is people who work for long periods of time on their laptops or computers.  This also means that these people, ideally would also work with multiple monitors, or other systems that would allow for having this website open and constantly viewable.

## Key Scenarios: ## 
For somebody working at their computer for many hours a day, a fresh quote from The Quote Wall is a great way to break up the monotony and to keep them on task. A motivating and inspirational quote from a favourite actor or author might be just what is needed to help push through a slow workday.

## Key Principles: ##
*Ease of use* - The website should be easy to understand and simple to use. The website is designed for people who are working, so they shouldn't be bogged down clicking through difficult-to-understand menus or settings. They should be able to quickly log on, load their profile, and get back to work.

*Customizability* - The user should be able to choose how and when their content is shown to them. They should be able to choose their interests so that their quotes are tailored to them, as well as the frequency of the quotes so they never feel like they go too long without something interesting happening. Text size and accessibility options should also be available.
