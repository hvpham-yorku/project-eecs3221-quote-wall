# 📝 Team Collaboration Report  

## 👥 Team Structure & Workflow  
Our team consists of **four members**, and we have adopted a **flexible and collaborative** approach to task distribution. Instead of assigning tasks rigidly, we allow members to **volunteer** for the sections they feel most comfortable working on. Once someone completes their task, they either move on to a new section or assist other teammates if needed.  

## 🗓️ Team Meetings & Communication  
We hold **team meetings every Tuesday or Thursday**, depending on everyone's availability. These in-person sessions provide an opportunity for us to work together, discuss progress, and resolve any challenges efficiently.  

When we are not meeting in person, we communicate via **Discord**, sending messages and sometimes jumping on calls for discussions.  

## 📌 User Story Definition Process  
Our approach to defining **user stories** is **dynamic and collaborative**. Whenever someone comes up with a new story, they share it in our **Discord chat**. The team then discusses its **relevance and feasibility** before deciding whether to include it.  

The **voting process** is usually straightforward, often requiring only **one round of discussion**, though we refine the stories as needed to improve **clarity and structure**.  

## 🚀 Sprint 0 Challenges & Improvements  
Sprint 0 posed some challenges, particularly in **time management**. Our schedules have been packed with **midterms**, making it difficult to complete tasks in one sitting. Instead, progress has required **multiple days and extensive discussions** through messages.  

## 🎯 Moving Forward into Sprint 1 
We aim to prioritize the project more efficiently with our time and effort by allocating dedicated work periods. We would want to set a strong foundation for future sprint 2.
