### 1. User Friendly Design: ###
  - As Diana
    > I recommend this website to all sorts of people. I want an easy-to-use design that anyone can pick up and understand.

### 2. Clean and Compact Interface: ###
  - As Bart
    > I need to be able to quickly access and set up the website so I can get back to work. I do not want to get lost in a sea of buttons and menus.

  - As Diana
    > Buttons and menus should clearly indicate their purpose and should be designed intuitively.

### 3. Accessibility Options ###
  - As Diana
    > I want to be able to choose between a light and dark mode for the user interface, to better suit my viewing in a high or low lighting environment.

  - As Bart
    > I want an option for the website to play a sound cue when a new quote is given, so I know when something has changed.

### 4. Fullscreen / Compact Mode ###
  - As Bart
    > When glancing at the website, I don't want to be distracted by buttons  or unnecessary text. I want a toggle for menu or UI elements so the main focus can be on the quote.

  - As Diana
    > I want the design and user interface to be as unobtrusive and non-distracting as possible. The website's purpose is to add spice to your day, not to occupy a great deal of your time.

# Frontend: #

### 1. Selection of Interests ###
  - As Bart
    > I want the quotes that appear to be tailored to my interests; and to be from a wide range of people and topics I know.

  - As Diana
    > I want the option to add new interests, or to edit any of my existing preferences.

### 2. Personalized Scheduling ###
  - As Diana
    > I want to be able to select how often I see new quotes, that way, things never feel too stagnant or slow.

### 3. Customizable Interface ###
  - As Bart
    > I want to be able to choose how my content is displayed to me, including the size and positioning of the text.

  - As Diana
    > I want to be able to choose how quotes are cycled. Whether it is a hard change, fade, or another type of transition.

### 4. Soothing Imagery ###
  - As Diana
    > I want quotes to be accompanied by a relaxing or visually pleasing image, something nice to accompany the quote.

### 5. Additional Display ###

# Backend: #

### 1. Profile Storage ###
  - As Diana
    > I want my preferences and interests to be stored so that I do not need to reconfigure the website every time I log on.

### 2. Quote Wall Account ###
  - As Bart
    > I want my preferences to be transferrable between devices, such as my home and work laptop. I want to be able to create an account so I can sign in on any device and have access to my preferences and interests.

  - As Diana
    > I want my username and password to be unique to myself, and I want my information to be stored securely so only I have access to my preferences.

### 3. Recency Filter ###
  - As Diana
    > I want to avoid seeing the same quotes multiple times in a short span of time, so every time I receive a new quote, I get to see something new and fresh.

  - As Bart
    > I have many different interests, so I want to be able to manage the frequency of different interests so I don't get a hot streak of several quotes coming from the same interest without a little variation.

### 4. Variated Quote Selection ###
  - As Bart
    > If I have selected multiple interests, I want the quotes displayed to come from this group of topics.
