## Product Descriptions:
### Momentum:

## How is our Product Different?
Our product, unlike those above, offers users a much more tailored experience as it provides them with **quotes** and **messages** that correspond directly to their interests.
While other products treat quotes as a secondary feature, our application centers around them, making user interaction with quotes and messages the core experience.

## Who is our Product Better for?
Unlike _Momentum_ which displays general quotes and _I Am_ which provides users with general affirmations, our app tailors its quotes and messages to give the user a experience catered to their preferences. Design wise our program differs from some of the previously mentioned applications, as the focus is placed much more on a minimalistic approach which greatly benefits users who are looking for an astethic background.

## Why do Competitors not Focus on Catered Quotes & Messages?
Competing applications prioritize different aspects of their own respective markets. For example, _Momentum_, focuses on user productivity with a sleek, minimalistic interface. _I Am_ and _Fabulous_ emphasize affirmations, habit-building, and self-care.
These applications do not focus on personalized quotes and messages as doing so could divulge users from their core purpose. Additionally, apps like _Fabulous_ cater to a specific demographic, making it easier to provide messages relevant to their audience.
While _Momentum_ and _I Am_ could shift their focus towards personalized quotes, doing so would introduce unnecessary complexity.
